How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? -

It was great to see the difference so that I could compare the particular line and find the bug immediately. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

 I will have a full record of all the changes done to the file. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

We can save at logical change instead of time change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
